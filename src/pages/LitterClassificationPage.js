            In this project we are focusing on using various open data sets. At the current stage, we will be working with 8 datasets, but we will be adding a few more datasets as the project progresses. Not all of these datasets will be utilized during the current iteration, but are being sources in anticipation for future iterations. Datasets for legal information and litter classification will be sources and added to this once located, these are the particular datasets that will be pertinent to iteration 1.
